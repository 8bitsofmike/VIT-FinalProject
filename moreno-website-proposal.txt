Project Proposal:

A website that is a day in a glance. This page would include local weather, a list of todo tasks (which can be edited/checked off), and reminders. Offers a log in/registration mechanism to let users customize their day-in-a-glance. 

Stretch Goals:
Integrate with native calendar (CALDav, Google Calendar)
Share items with other users
Link to other users
Send Fistbumps to other users for recognition
